# Boxer-HTML: re-implementing the Boxer programming system using web technologies


## Scope Specification
The aim of this project is to explore the possibility of re-implementing the Boxer programming system, utilizing the front-end web ecosystem, mainly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The main objective is implementing the functionality in figure 2 of the article "Boxer: a reconstructible computational medium" [^1].

## Used Technologies
The programming system will be implemented using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This group of languages has been chosen for the interactive and graphical options they provide, as well as high portability and editability.
Individual boxes are defined using (custom) HTML tags and interpreted during page load through javascript.
The graphic aspects of the system are defined using HTML and styled using CSS.
